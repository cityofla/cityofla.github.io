If you're reading this you are, more than likely, human. Let that sink in for a moment. You are because you perceive. That is, your perception is an immediate validation of your existence.

Perception is a singularly inescapable aspect of being alive. The variance and unpredictability of each individual's perception gives contour, texture and meaning to our lives. We move through this world as ever-morphing puzzle pieces, growing, learning and changing based on our perceptions. All that chaos and beauty forms a living, evolving mosaic of energy — LIFE.

I used a lot of words to essentially say *life is grand*.

Surely, I could have conveyed my meaning without dragging you through the doldrums of my verbosity. But I didn't. I flourished almost to the point of losing track of my own idea. In writing, there is **always** a more efficient way to say something. But it's easy to err on the side of too many words, too much information. Writing well is a struggle. It requires clarity and focus. It demands purpose and intent.

Coding is good writing. It is inherently focused and functional; purpose births utility. Test driven development is an unambiguous self-editing process. Accuracy, efficacy and elegance are the standard. 

A programmer's first challenge is to identify need. Code empowers me to meet that need. Coding solves problems. I love solving problems. Ergo...

The pictured timepieces are creations of different eras. Separated by 70 years and 4000 miles, one ticks loudly and needs to be wound daily. The other keeps perfect time, uninterrupted. Each watch was crafterd by an artisan using a timecode framework and aesthetic syntax.

Programmers can't control time. But we can shape utility. We can enhance user-experience. I want to deliver fun in function. I want to solve problems. I want to creat beautiful tools. Coding lets me do that.
